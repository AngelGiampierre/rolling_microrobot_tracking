# rolling_microrobot_tracking
005/100: This project is focused on tracking the position of a microrobot using computer vision techniques. The system processes video frames, detects the microrobot's position, and generates a trajectory plot of its path. It can be applied to scenarios where precision tracking of small obkects is crucia, such as in micro-manipulation. In addition, obtaining the position of the microrobot is necessary to close the control loop, to have feedback and to be able to apply the control rules.
